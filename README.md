rock, paper, scissors game

_Presenting my first Python Programs which covers most of the Python Fundermentals..

This game focuses mainly on Decision-Making and Control Structures.
Using the "random" module, the computer will randomly select an option from the list of valid choices

The game firstly takes the User's Input to allow the user to creata a "User Name" which stored Globally

The "playiing_game" variable is initialized as True 
The "player_choice" variable is initialized as None(initially containing nothing)
Both the "player_score" and "computer_choice" variables are initially Zero
The "turns" variable contains the number of turns played, which is initially set to Zero

Inside the "operate_game" function is where all the important decisions are made.This function runs a "while loop" which continues executing for as the two conditions are met.

Once the loop executes the number of turns will increment by 1 for each execution until it reaches 3 and the playing_game becomes False and the game terminates if the User does not want to play again.
